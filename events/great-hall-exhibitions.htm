            <p class="content"> An installation of two artworks by <span class="strong">Felix Gonzalez-Torres</span> will be featured this spring as part of the Great Hall Exhibitions series at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. Organized by Katharine J. Wright and Susanna V. Temkin, this installation pairs two works encompassing different media and conceptual practices that speak to major themes in the artist's oeuvre. The manifestable candy piece "Untitled (Placebo-Landscape-for Roni)", 1993 and the static photographic work "Untitled" (Natural History), 1990 offer a point of access into overarching strategies that the artist employed throughout the course of his career. The two works were on view daily, <span data-term="goog_1726911978" tabindex="0">1:00 to 4:00 PM</span>, from March 30 - May 1, 2015. </p>

            <p class="content">Embracing the instability of perspective and form, New York artist Marta Chilindron (b. 1951, Buenos Aires) creates manipulable sculptures in transparent and colored acrylics.&nbsp; Adapted from such basic geometric shapes as spheres, cubes, and pyramids, her artworks conceal their identity as complex, kinetic constructions.&nbsp; Constructed from multiple panels connected by hinges, Chilindron’s sculptures are charged with transformative potential that, when activated by the viewer, cause the works to expand//fold//collapse.</p>
            <p class="content">An heir to international constructivism, Chilindron's artworks recall the influence of such artists as Naum Gabo, Lygia Clark, and Donald Judd.&nbsp; However, to this tradition Chilindron adds her own investigations based on her interest in the dynamism and mutability of life.&nbsp; Controlled by the viewer yet mediated by their constructed forms, her artworks transform shape, shift from the second to the third dimension, and extend and contract into space.&nbsp; Magnified by the chromatic interplay caused by the effects of light, these changes underlie the core of her artistic practice.</p>
            <p class="content">Providing a dramatic contrast to the ornate interior of the Duke House, seven works by the artist will be on view in the lobby and vestibule of the Institute of Fine Arts&nbsp; for the Fall 2014 Great Hall Exhibition.&nbsp; Focusing on Chilindron’s engagement with idealized geometric forms, these works, executed between 2006 and 2014, will show the diversity of the artist’s practice, ranging from table-top objects such as the curvilinear <span class="italic">Helix</span> (2011) to her large-scale <span class="italic">Cube 48 Orange</span> (2014).&nbsp; This latter work represents Chilindron’s expansion into immersive sculptural environments, and is being shown in New York for the first time since its debut in the <span class="italic">Encounters</span> exhibition at Art Basel Hong Kong, held in spring 2014. </p>
            <p class="content">For more information about Marta Chilindron and the exhibition, EXPAND//FOLD//COLLAPSE, please <a href="great-hall-exhibitions-publications.htm">read the exhibition e-catalogue</a>, co-written by PhD candidates Susanna V. Temkin and Kath<strong>a</strong>rine J. Wright.

  <p class="content"><img class="imagecontent" src="../images/navimages/Night-Sherbert.jpg" alt="Lynda Benglis" width="300" height="231" align="left">One of the foundational figures in twentieth<strong>-</strong>century feminist art, Lynda Benglis has been creating works that explore the ways in which the body, in both its physical and cultural extensions and constraints, interacts with the world around it. Benglis first received international attention in the late 1960s for a series of works in which she poured brightly colored bands of liquid polyurethane foam and pigmented latex directly on the gallery floor. With their unconventional palette and materials and their ambiguous identity between painting and sculpture, these works initiated Benglis&rsquo;s career-long project of questioning and expanding the boundaries of artistic media, materials, and form. Her works&rsquo; radical aesthetic innovation coupled with their overt critique of dominant modes of artistic practice—from modernist painting to minimalist sculpture—suggest alternative ways of seeing and being unburdened from the repressive verities and traditions of the past. This motivating dichotomy of Benglis&rsquo;s art is perhaps most evident in her consistent engagement with the ostensibly antagonistic processes of creative amalgamation and material degradation, figured through the works&rsquo; invocation of melting, dripping, and deformation. This ruin-like aspect of many of Benglis&rsquo;s works reveals currents of classicism and romanticism running through her oeuvre, albeit deeply informed by feminist critiques of historical continuity and expressive individualism. As such the Institute of Fine Arts provides an ideal intellectual and architectural milieu in which to examine the complex interplay between innovation and tradition that motivates a great deal of Benglis&rsquo;s art.&nbsp; On view at the IFA will be four artworks, two of which are seminal &ldquo;pours&rdquo; from the late 1960s.            </p>
