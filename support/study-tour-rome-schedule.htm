 Arrive this morning in the Eternal City and transfer to the five-star Grand Hotel de la Minerve overlooking  that greatest of Roman monuments, the Pantheon. Following lunch at the hotel, stretch your legs on a walk to the Campidoglio, Michelangelo’s urban masterpiece, and stop for a visit at Il Gesù, with its astounding illusionistic ceiling by Gaulli, a hallmark of the Roman Baroque. The balance of the afternoon is at leisure. This evening, gather for a lecture by Professor William Hood before attending a welcome reception and dinner at an elegant rooftop restaurant.<br>

        <img src="../images/support/roman-villa-borghese.jpg" alt="Villa Borghese" width="300" height="163" class="image" align="right">Cardinal Scipione Borghese built the Villa Borghese to house one of the first and among the most  important collector-curated private collections in Europe. We  will study the genesis and development of this extraordinary collection, formed by one of the major taste-makers of the 17th century. See works by Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio, and Canova, as well as Bernini masterpieces. Following lunch on your own, enjoy an optional walk through Campo de’ Fiori and Piazza Farnese, and end at Palazzo Spada for a visit to the remarkable Spada Collection. Return to the hotel for another informative lecture, followed by dinner.<br>

        Today, travel to the Colli Albani (Alban Hills), a quiescent volcanic area just south of Rome. Here, popes and cardinals have built through the centuries their summer residences, known as Castelli Romani (Roman Castles). Despite what the name may suggest, the castelli aren’t castles, but hill towns with an ancient history, frequented by many noble families from Rome. In Frascati, visit the most important of the estates: Villa Aldobrandini, a perfect example of the early Italian Baroque style. After lunch, discover Villa Falconieri, considered by many the oldest of the villas of Frascati, and whose main building was largely redesigned by Francesco Borromini in the 17th century. Continue to Villa Mondragone, located at the top of a hill and decorated with several dragons, the heraldic symbols of Pope Gregory XIII. Return to Rome for an evening at leisure.          <br>

        This morning see the superb painting  collection at the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica in the beautiful  Palazzo Barberini. Following lunch, explore the Ludovisi Collection at Palazzo Altemps. This building houses a stunning collection of antiquities consisting of Greek and Roman sculptures  that in the 16th and 17th centuries belonged to various families of the Roman nobility. Before returning to the hotel for an evening  lecture, enjoy a walk through Piazza Navona, renowned for its Baroque architecture and the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Dinner is on your own.  <br>

        Begin the day with a visit to San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane, designed by the architect Francesco Borromini and an iconic masterpiece of Baroque architecture. Visit Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s Sant’Andrea al Quirinale, considered by the architect to be one of his best works and an exceptional example of Roman Baroque architecture. Continue to the Fontana di Trevi to learn about Rome’s 17th-century aqueducts. Following lunch on your own, visit the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj, whose collection includes works by Caravaggio, Bernini, Algardi, and Velázquez. The rest of the afternoon is at leisure, before gathering for dinner at a lively local restaurant.</p>

        <img src="../images/support/rome-orvieto-cathedral.jpg" alt="Orvieto Cathedral" width="300" height="161" class="image" align="right">Depart this morning for Villa Farnese, located  at the top of the town of Caprarola. The villa is one of the  finest examples of Renaissance architecture, with ornaments  used sparingly to achieve harmony and proportion.  Commissioned by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese in the 16th century, it was originally constructed as a fortified  residence, which is still evident in the two towers flanking the main entrance. After lunch, drive to Orvieto, a lovely town that sits on top of a volcanic cliff that looks out over cypress-dotted plains. Check in at the hotel Palazzo Piccolomini and attend  an afternoon lecture before dinner.</p>

       Today begins with a walking tour of Orvieto, one of the major centers of Etruscan civilization  eventually taken over by Rome. From the 11th century onward, the popes maintained an aggressive political presence in central Italy, but only Orvieto and Viterbo had papal palaces. Visit the Duomo with its intriguing Gothic façade and remarkable frescoed interior, then walk to the famous Pozzo di San Patrizio (Well of St. Patrick), built by Pope Clement VII during the sack of Rome in 1527. Concerned that the city’s water supply might be insufficient in the event of siege by Charles V’s troops, Clement commissioned this spectacular well. Following lunch, continue the exploration of this unique town, and attend an evening lecture. Dinner is at leisure, perhaps to enjoy one of the local restaurants.</p>

         <img src="../images/support/rome-villa-lante.jpg" alt="Villa Lante, Bagnaia" width="300" class="image" align="right">After breakfast, drive to Villa Lante at Bagnaia. This delightful Renaissance garden features  fountains, terraces, and dripping grottoes. The harmonious choreography of water and the mechanical perfection of its flow are an excellent  example of hydraulic engineering of the time. After lunch in the countryside, continue to Bomarzo Gardens, also called “Park of the Monsters.” Built in the 16th century, the park is a perfect  example of a Baroque monumental complex. This evening  celebrate a memorable trip with a festive farewell dinner.</p>
