The team also found the first known evidence of looting by the Carthaginians after taking Selinunte in 409 BCE.

                <a href="tom-crow-nga-videos.htm"><img class="image" src="../images/press/tom-crow-nga2.jpg" alt="Jacques-Louis David" align="left"></a>In this six-part lecture series entitled <em>Restoration as Event and Idea: Art in Europe, 1814-1820</em>, art historian Thomas Crow considers the period following the fall of Napoleon. During this time, artists throughout Europe were left uncertain and adrift, with old certainties and boundaries dissolved. How did they then set new courses for themselves? Professor Crow's lectures answer that question by offering both the wide view of art centers across the continent—Rome, Paris, London, Madrid, Brussels—and a close-up focus on individual actors— Francisco Goya (1746-1828), Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825), Antonio Canova (1757-1822), Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867), and Theodore Gericault (1791-1824). Whether directly or indirectly, these artists were linked in a new international network with changed artistic priorities and new creative possibilities emerging from the wreckage of the old. <a href="tom-crow-nga-videos.htm">Read More and watch or listen online.</a></p>

In this way, the sculptures share an affinity with the Great Hall: both showcase a precision of design and a scrupulousness of construction. Former robber-baron homes quite naturally lend themselves to the presentation of Old Master paintings, but the minimalist forms, bright colors, and industrial materials of Chilindron’s sculptures have their own vivacity in such a setting, acting as a meaningful foil to the Beaux-Arts architecture while generating unexpected similarities.<a href="http://hyperallergic.com/165498/the-infinite-forms-of-marta-chilindrons-manipulable-sculptures/" target="_blank"> Read more</a><img src="../images/navimages/newwindow.gif" width="12" height="11" alt="Open link in new window"><br>

They were found built into the foundations of a post-antique or early medieval building and are in a very good state of preservation. The find has also been announced in the <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/headless-statues-unearthed-in-aphrodisias-excavations.aspx?pageID=238&nID=29194&NewsCatID=375" target="_blank">Turkish media (click here for the article)</a>. One of the figures wears Greek civilian dress (tunic and cloak) and is of mid-imperial date, c. AD 200. He is displayed in a dynamic posture, holding a book scroll in his left hand. The other figure wears a late antique Roman toga and is of the fifth century AD. It has a stolid four-square posture, a thick chest, and an unusually fat belly. The second statue probably represented a governor or other high-ranking office-holder in the imperial administration.
