         <span class="headingexpanding">by Gary Schneider</span><br>
         <span class="content">21 September to 2 November 2015</span><br>
            <p class="headingBROCHURE"><span class="italic">NUDES</span></p>
            <br>
          <p class="content">Gary Schneider’s extraordinary nude photographs, 2001-2005, evolved from working with a small flashlight in total darkness, sustaining the exposure on film for about an hour, to trace whole body portraits of friends. Perfecting the process over several years, he created unusual studies that explore both psychological and physical presence. Schneider muses that “there are so many variables” in creating frank yet mysterious and unique individual portraits, which are photographic records of the performance of exposure. </p>
          
          <p class="content">Schneider describes the counting process during film exposure, and the complexity of the interaction with his subjects:</p>
            <p class="content">“I count the light out loud—it becomes a chanting meditation for me, and my subject becomes as involved in my performance as I am in theirs. The only task I ask of my subject is to gaze toward the lens…To break the camera face, I have different strategies. I count, make comments, make the subject blink while exposing each eye, and so on. The information is accumulated sequentially on one sheet of film. Just as a movie unfolds in real time, so I build the image by exposing one part of the person after another with my tiny light. If I add more light, it emphasizes that body part; conversely, not enough light and that area never becomes visible. I expose the parts of the body in the same sequence in order to exaggerate the differences between each person’s performance. I photograph the head, then move down the right side, then up the left side. In all of the portraits there is an interesting shift in the gaze, from the right eye to the left eye. This is a result of the long interval between exposing the two eyes. What happens during the session remains private, an intimate act between me and the subject. There is an enormous amount of information collected during the session, both emotional and physical…accumulation of all this information is impossible to interpret simply or decisively.” <br>

Horses and cowboys, when seen, dominate the rolling landscape of open grazing and grassland, sparse treelines and rugged peaks that characterize this wild open range and give it a mythic quality. <a href="#">Read more &gt;</a></p>

The <span class="italic">24 Ore </span>embody the process of memory itself, its limitations and demands for selection and compression: a house must become a small, portable case; years passed within its walls must become only moments of in-ward reflection. <a href="displaycases-kikki-ghezzi.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

Using techniques favored by many artists of the 18th century, Cottam excerpts images taken from the headlines or news snippets, and converts them into riveting and intense studies. Delicately rendered in white crayon against a blue page, they are silky threads of memory. Recording moments of journalism, depicting pieces of people, bodies, and the residual effects of mindless, senseless killing, Cottam draws what is reported on the news. <a href="displaycases-benjamin-cottam.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

This series of paintings emerged from his experience of language, and its permutations, as the artist experienced harsh words in common parlance, called out loud on streets among friends and strangers every day in public and private in the City.</p>
                <p class="content">Each small painting has the same dimensions. The panel depths vary, implying the hurt of the words, how deeply they penetrate as they are uttered.

The first light in the night sky, it is often seen low on the horizon just after sunset. Ericsson plays with the subsequent interpretation of Lucifer as the favored angel who falls from grace, becoming identified with forces of darkness. In these photograms, Lucifer brings light to the paper, revealing a woman&rsquo;s form, fashioning her contours against glossy black.<br>

                Playing with light and dark, edges and shadows, Ericsson manipulates both muse and medium to create a sensuous and luminous image. <a href="displaycases-tr-ericsson.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

Using a different medium each time, sometimes paint, sometimes egg, sometimes pigment and oils, she circulates images into a basin of water, dropping viscous liquids into a receptive tray filled with water, coloring the movement and ripples on the surface, with these intense and delicious substances. At times they are suspended like a meniscus on the surface, at times they form shapes, and then dissolve, trailing tails behind.</p>

reflections of majestic landscapes, made on site as he traveled through Norway's fjords and 

mountains, many of the small works later inspired larger paintings and drawings when he 

returned to his studio. They convey his immediate responses to Norwegian landscape. His own 

words describe his impressions:</p>
          <p class="content">1991. Lofoten, an archipelago within the Artic Circle, mountainous islands reach out into the Norwegian Sea. In late May the &ldquo;midnight sun&rdquo; floats along the horizon. Dusk becomes dawn; one day runs into the next. I was working with pastels using my fingers to grind pigment into pigment. This physical act extends my being directly into the paper. The work is not driven by conscious thought, rather by a series of sensations and the rhythm of my hands responding to the moment. <a href="displaycases-michael-kirk.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

One kneels on the floor in an empty room filling with balloons that drop randomly from the ceiling, and later sits in a chair, lifting her face to a shower of golden glitter raining down upon her skin. The other perches on a chair in a bay window, naked except for the paint on her face, and the tulle enveloping her lower limbs. She moves without speaking, holding a bird in a cage.

Animals inhabit an interior and domestic landscape, coming to life and interacting with their environment. A group of branches in a vase waves cautiously as if bent by wind toward an unseen place, breaking into pieces and wispy fragments for no apparent reason. A slipcover begins to growl as if ready for attack. A hidden dragon slithers to life in the folds of a drapery, leaving fire in its wake. An archer shoots at a trophy stag from the
                  comfort of his decorative pose on an ovoid telephone table. A flock of birds twitter against
                  the back of a sofa. A living room is submerged in standing water, colorless, and linear. A
                  blue mattress, its coils exposed, floats away on an ocean of coiled lines. The images form a
                personal narrative of disquiet. <a href="displaycases-eliana-perez.htm">Read more &gt; </a></p>

As an immigrant to the United States from Korea in 1996, his continued fascination with these interactions has led him to create an art practice that embraces sculpture and installation to create interactive spaces. Working in both large-scale monumental sculpture and intimate conceptual pieces, he brings sensitivity and power to his work. Because he wants to break through the confining divisions between audience and artist, he asks a wide range of participants to bring their own concerns to transform his pieces. <a href="displaycases-jongil-ma.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

                  marks the beginning of the Year of the Horse, the seventh sign of the Chinese zodiac and an auspicious year recognizing
                  the power and primal nature of the horse. The end date of the exhibition, 17 March marks Saint Patrick’s Day, named
          for the patron saint of Ireland, where Timothy Hawkesworth grew up on a farm and began his relationship with horses. </p>
                <p class="content">Hawkesworth’s horses are energetic and rapidly drawn with graphite over wax and paint on paper, moving from right to
left, galloping, rearing, and walking with heads bowed, raised or thrown back in restless movement. Evoking the animal
nature with figurative representations, like Susan Rothenberg’s horses from the 1970s, Hawkesworth infuses a personal
vision in these drawings, and taps into a source of infinite fascination: domesticated animals that retain a wild and
untamed spirit. <a href="displaycases-timothy-hawkesworth.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

                <p class="content">Christopher Smith's <span class="italic">Alabaster and Albacore</span> is a series of lush and velvety photographic prints, showing proposed video installations in the interiors of recognizable landmarks and public spaces, including the James B. Duke House. &nbsp;In this body of work Smith engages themes of transience and permanence, movement and color, nature and displacement.&nbsp;</p>
                <p class="content">Taking elements of color and bubbles from his ongoing &quot;Painter Project,&quot; Smith transforms them, draping them over the railings of staircases, suspending them from the skylights and floating them across the floor toward the viewer. &nbsp;Using techniques attuned classic films like as director Carol Reed&rsquo;s &ldquo;Odd Man Out (1947, Two Cities film), Jean-Luc Godard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two or Three Things I Know About Her,&rdquo; (1967, Argos Films), or Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s 1976 classic, &ldquo;Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Smith hones in on the bubbles floating in front of the camera as visual metaphors for the transience of life, the fragility of the moment. <a href="displaycases-christopher-smith.htm">Read more &gt;</a></p>

The transformation of the text of James Ferguson's&nbsp;<span class="italic">Astronomy</span>&nbsp;<span class="italic">Explained upon Sir Isaac Newton’s Principles </span>(1799) began in response to a Victorian astronomy book entitled&nbsp;<span class="italic">Flowers of the Sky</span>&nbsp;in the archive of the John Work Garrett Library at Johns Hopkins University.</p>
              <p class="content">As the artist describes, the fluid yet tenuous painting on the book pages is analogous to a fragile web or distant constellation. For Smith, flowers are symbols of our selves and of nature, as well as a metaphor for the machinations of the universe. Implicitly, book folios serve as multivalent supports for the painted leaves and flowers that adorn them with color and design imposed over printed words.  <a href="displaycases-william-smith.htm"> Read more &gt;</a>            </p>
